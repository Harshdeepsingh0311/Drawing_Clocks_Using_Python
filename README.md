# Drawing Clocks Using Python

I have created these clocks using a python module named as turtle and other in tkinter. It is very simple to build and very effective also. You can set it's colors according to your choice and also i have created a pip package named as clockpkg to create this analog clock in just 3 lines of code.

## Implementation of Analog Clock 

There is a function named as draw clock which takes hour, minute, seconds as arguments and draws the clock accordingly. So i created a while loop which calculates all these parameters and sends to the function to draw the clock accordingly and continously, you can change the colour of this clock's hands and the background as well.

## Implementation of Digital Clock

Implementation of this clock is the simplest as it just creates the function and then repeats it everytime and the basic infrastructure of this clock is that there is a label which gets updated everytime.


**Feel free to ask any query related to anything and use the code for the same, you can improve this repository by raising issues and solving it. This is very simple but effective way of creating clocks using modules like turtle and tkinter. Looking towards for your cooperation.....**
